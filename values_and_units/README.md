# Values and Units


## Keywords, Strings and Text values

### Keywords
Keywords are ways to represents a value. for example ``` none ```

- By default, the ```a``` element have its text-decoration to be set as underline, if you set the keyword ```none``` to it, it removes the underline from it.

- Even if a property shares the same keyword, their behaviours cant be the same. for example, ```normal``` in letter-spacing is not the same as the ```normal``` in font-style


#### Global keywords

There are three global keywords accepted by every CSS property.
They are :

1. ```inherit```
2. ```initial```
3. ```unset```
